### Problem Solving Flow

```text
1. Read constraints first.
2. Identify the pattern: array, string, graph, tree, DP, greedy, backtracking.
3. Start with brute force and name the bottleneck.
4. Replace the bottleneck with a known tool: hash map, sort, heap, prefix, DP, graph traversal.
5. Prove the invariant: what stays true after every loop/recursive call?
6. Test edge cases: empty, one item, duplicates, negative values, max constraints.
7. State complexity clearly before final submission.
```
